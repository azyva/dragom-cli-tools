This is a base distribution package for Dragom tools.

It is not expected to be used as is since the Dragom execution environment
generally needs to be configured to suit a given Dragom installation.

The artifact produced by this module is expected to be reused by a
client-specific module which should extract this artifact and produce its own
distribution artifact by overlaying client-specific files, such as set-env.sh.
